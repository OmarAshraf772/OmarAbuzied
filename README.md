## My name is Omar I am a fresh graduate with a bachelor's degree in mechatronics engineering. This is where I store and showcase my work in various projects and courses, building my portfolio in machine learning/deep learning applications specifically.

## So far, here are some of the courses I have finished and some that I am still taking:

**TensorFlow Developer Certificate in 2023: Zero to Mastery** 
**-Udemy**
* TensorFlow Fundamentals
* Neural Network Regression with TensorFlow
* Neural Network Classification with TensorFlow
* Computer Vision and Convolutional Neural Networks with TensorFlow
* Transfer Learning with TensorFlow: Feature Extraction and Fine Tuning
* NLP Fundamentals in TensorFlow
* Time Series fundamentals in TensorFlow

**Advanced Computer Vision with TensorFlow
**-DeepLearning.AI through Coursera**
* Transfer Learning
* Object Localization
* Object Detection APIs
* Image Segmentation
* Interpretation, Saliency maps, and Class Activation maps

**Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing**
**-IBM through Coursera**
* Image Processing with Pillow
* Image Processing with OpenCV
* Image Manipulation
* Image Classification
* Convolutional Neural Networks
* Object Detection

**Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification**
**-Stanford Online Through Coursera**
* Supervised Learning
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Classification
* Gradient Descent

## And here are some of the projects that I have completed:

**Food Vision**
* A computer vision model able to classify 101 different kinds of foods.

**SkimLit**
* Replication of a the model which powers the PubMed 200k paper to classify different sequences in PubMed medical abstracts (which can help researchers read through medical abstracts faster

**BitPredict**
* 

**AI Virtual Voice Assistant using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
