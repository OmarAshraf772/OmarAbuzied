## My name is Omar I am a fresh graduate with a bachelor's degree in mechatronics engineering. This is where I store and showcase my work in various projects and courses, building my portfolio in machine learning/deep learning applications specifically.

## So far, here are some of the courses I have finished and some that I am still taking:

**PyTorch for Deep Learning Bootcamp**
-Udemy

* PyTorch Model Deployment


**TensorFlow Developer Certificate in 2023: Zero to Mastery** 
-Udemy
* TensorFlow Fundamentals
* Neural Network Regression with TensorFlow
* Neural Network Classification with TensorFlow

* Object Detection APIs
* Image Segmentation
* Interpretation, Saliency maps, and Class Activation maps

**Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing**
-IBM through Coursera
* Image Processing with Pillow

## And here are some of the projects that I have completed:

**Food Vision**
* A computer vision model able to classify 101 different kinds of foods.

**SkimLit**
* Replication of a the model which powers the PubMed 200k paper to classify different sequences in PubMed medical abstracts (which can help researchers read through medical abstracts faster

**BitPredict**
* building a series of forecasting models in an attempt to predict the price of Bitcoin.

**AI Virtual Voice Assistant using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
* the proposed project is a keyword-spotting machine learning algorithm instead of a full-scale speech recognition model. Such high-level models use what is known as a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which on top of being computationally demanding, is also rather difficult to adapt for the proposed application. The model that was built and used converted the raw sound file waveforms into corresponding spectrogram images to extract features. The spectrogram will then be employed as the input to a convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model used TensorFlow and the Keras deep-learning API to build and train the model on the selected dataset.
